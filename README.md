# PAGE 10: ESTIMATION OF POPULATION PARAMETERS
## Overview

In this page, we are performing a **population estimation** based on a sample dataset containing ages. The analysis involves calculating sample statistics and confidence intervals for the population mean and standard deviation. The critical steps and results are presented below, with visualizations to enhance the understanding of the statistical concepts.

_Key Data Science and Statistical Concepts Used_

### 1. **Loading and Processing Data**
The data is loaded from a CSV file, and the `age` column is extracted for statistical analysis.

### 2. **Sample Statistics**
- **Sample Size (n):** The number of entries in the `age` column.
- **Sample Mean:** The average age in the sample.
- **Sample Standard Deviation:** The measure of variability in the sample.

### 3. **Population Estimation**
- **Population Size (N):** The total number of individuals in the population (set to 1000 in this case).
- **Confidence Level (95%):** The level of certainty we have in our estimation.

### 4. **Confidence Intervals**
- **Population Mean Confidence Interval:** A range within which the true population mean is likely to lie, calculated using the sample mean and sample standard deviation.
- **Population Standard Deviation Confidence Interval:** A range within which the true population standard deviation is likely to lie, calculated using the sample's chi-square distribution.

### 5. **Standard Error of the Mean (SEM)**
This metric is used to estimate the precision of the sample mean as an estimate of the population mean.

### 6. **Critical Z-Value**
We calculate the critical z-value for a 95% confidence level using the standard normal distribution, which helps in defining the range of values for the confidence interval.

### 7. **Normal Distribution Curve**
The normal distribution curve is plotted to represent the probability density of the sample mean. A shaded region is used to represent the 95% confidence interval for the population mean.

### 8. **Plotly Visualization**
