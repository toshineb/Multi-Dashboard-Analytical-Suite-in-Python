## 🚧 Problem Statement

Despite the abundance of data, many professionals still struggle with:

- Manual analysis using Excel/SPSS
- High error rates in statistical inference
- Limited visualization and interactivity
- Difficulty building and interpreting ML models

This project eliminates those hurdles by providing automated workflows, visual tools, and integrated machine learning pipelines.

## 🔍 Core Objectives

- Build a full-stack analytics system with advanced statistics
- Deliver predictive insights using regression and hypothesis testing
- Simplify model deployment via Streamlit
- Enable decision-makers to **interact with data**, not just read it
